**AI Game**

A repository for implementation of artificial intelligence algorithm which includes machine learning and deep learning algorithm.  
There is my project of my scientific work from my highschool GBSL: https://www.gbsl.ch  
What I did was to make the AI play a videogame based on a racing game.  
The AI is a modification of the forked repository. It uses supervised-learning (backpropagation).
